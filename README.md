# Piezoelectric Rate Gyroscope Using COMSOL

This project focuses on modeling and simulating the behavior of a piezoelectric rate gyroscope using COMSOL Multiphysics software. A piezoelectric rate gyroscope is an inertial sensor designed to measure the angular velocity or rate of rotation within a system. It typically consists of a thin piezoelectric material positioned between two electrodes, along with specific mechanical structures that provide sensitivity and stability. The piezoelectric material generates an electric charge in proportion to the angular velocity applied to it, which can then be measured to determine the rate of rotation.

## Project Objectives:

- **Design of Piezoelectric Gyroscope Structure:** The project involves designing the structural components of a piezoelectric gyroscope.

- **Simulation with COMSOL:** Utilizing COMSOL software to simulate the designed gyroscope, allowing for a detailed analysis of its behavior.

- **Angular Velocity Computation:** Calculating angular velocity and creating graphs to visualize the relationship between sense voltage and angular frequency, as well as sense voltage and frequency.

- **Comparison of Materials:** Comparing the simulation results of two different materials used in the gyroscope design.

## Key Simulation Details:

This project model demonstrates the analysis of a tuning fork-based piezoelectric rate gyroscope. The reverse piezoelectric effect is employed to drive an in-plane tuning fork mode, which is subsequently coupled to an out-of-plane mode due to the Coriolis force. The resulting out-of-plane motion is sensed using the direct piezoelectric effect. The geometry of the tuning forks is carefully designed to ensure that the eigenfrequencies of nearby modes are well-separated in frequency space. The frequency response of the system is computed, and the sensitivity to rotation rates is evaluated.

This project not only showcases proficiency in using simulation software but also highlights the understanding of piezoelectric materials and their application in designing precision sensors.
